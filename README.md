# GM-Utils
contains codes that I use in every App I develop for Android and iOS

---------------------------------------------

Those class I use them in all App that I develop. create them over past time. I always update them with each new idea or compatable change.

---------------------------------------------

My Stratigy in coding in simple:
- Never repeate any code
- Implement code to be available for any other App 
- Design your structure as you design a factory where you devide it to sections; for ex. a section for remote commutication, a section for archive, a section for production, a section for management and coordinate and so force. you decide what it is suitable for your App.
